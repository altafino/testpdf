idea:
- create a Go http server project, that is hosting a HTMX based frontend
- the frontend let the user upload a pdf file
- after receiving the pdf, the server should extract the data, using github.com/altafino/mindee-client to extract the data
- the server should then show the data in a nice tailwind css styled html page
